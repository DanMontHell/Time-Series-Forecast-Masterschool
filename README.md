# 🛒 Grocery Sales Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

This project builds a machine learning model to forecast daily item sales across stores in the **Guayas region** of Ecuador using real-world data from [Corporación Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting/data) on Kaggle. The goal was to predict future demand and optimize inventory, using a blend of classical and modern machine learning techniques.

> **Project Duration:** 4 weeks  
> **Forecast Period:** January – March 2014  
> **Model Type:** XGBoost Regressor  
> **Best Model Performance:**  
> • MAE: **0.0562**  
> • MAPE: **1.66%**  
> • R² Score: **0.8379**

## 📦 Data Sources

From the [Kaggle competition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting/data):

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `train.csv` | Daily unit sales per item per store |
| `items.csv` | Metadata on item family, class, and perishability |
| `stores.csv` | Store metadata: city, state, cluster |
| `transactions.csv` | Daily transactions count per store |
| `oil.csv` | Daily oil prices (Ecuador is oil-dependent) |
| `holidays_events.csv` | Local/national holidays & their characteristics |
| `onpromotion` | Binary flag indicating promotional activity per item/store/day |

## 💻 Setting Up Your Environment

I recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

## 📊 EDA & Feature Engineering

Key steps included:

- **Filtering to Guayas region** and selecting top 3 product families: `GROCERY I`, `BEVERAGES`, and `CLEANING`
- Handling **missing dates** and filling zero sales
- Transforming `unit_sales` to deal with extreme outliers
- Generating time-based features (day of week, month, holidays)
- Adding lag-based and rolling mean features
- Merging datasets (oil prices, holiday events, promotions, etc.)
